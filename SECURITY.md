# Reporting security issues

If you think you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/pillarproject) for assets in scope or send an email to [security@etherspot.io](mailto:security@etherspot.io). This address can be used for all of Etherspot's open source (including but not limited to SDK, BUIDler). 

Etherspot will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

**Important:** We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it have been fixed and announced, unless you received a response from the Etherspot security team that you can do so.
